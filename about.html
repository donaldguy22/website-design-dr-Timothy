                                    <h3>Understanding chiropractic</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Chiropractic Healthcare is a branch of medicine that is based on the scientific <br>
                                        principle that our Central Nervous System (CNS) controls or influences the functions  <br>
                                        of ALL 11 trillion interconnected cells in our bodies. The term CHIROPRACTIC comes from  <br>
                                        the Greek word "Cheiro and Praktikos" meaning "done by hand." The Chiropractic or wellness <br>
                                          model of health is centered on the philosophy that the human body will heal itself given the  <br>
                                          right opportunity. In other words, the body heals from the inside out. <br>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Interference to the nervous 
                                        system, caused by a vertebral subluxation complex (more commonly called a Subluxation) will
                                        affect how 
                                        the nervous system relates to the cells to which it influences. Think of nerve irritation 
                                        like a dimmer
                                        switch on your lights. If the dimmer is turned down, the lights are still on, 
                                      but the light is low. If it is turned up too high, 
                                        the bulb may burn out prematurely;
                                    </p>
                            </div>

                                  <h3>Understanding chiropractic|The spine</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      therefore, the muscle or organ still receives the nerve impulse, but is altered. 
                                      This helps to explain why when nerve irritation exists in the middle back region,
                                      an individual may experience indigestion or an upset stomach. As a Doctor of Chiropractic
                                      (D.C.), I essentially promote the healing process by minimizing interference to the Central 
                                      Nervous System. By detecting and correcting nerve interference, The Doctor of Chiropractic 
                                      facilitates the healing process, but it is YOUR body that does the healing! Understanding 
                                      Your Spine:
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      A short course in the basics of spinal anatomy is tremendously helpful in understanding 
                                      why the chiropractic profession is the number one source of alternative care in entire world! The central 
                                      nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord) is connected to the peripheral nervous system (the spinal 
                                      and peripheral nerves) and controls the way we move and function. Our skulls protect our brain and brain
                                      stem, and the spine provides superior protection to our spinal cord and spinal nerves.

                                    <h3>The spine continued ...</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The spine is a column of small bones called "vertebrae" that supports
                                        the entire upper body. The column is grouped into three sections:
                                        The cervical spine (neck), the thoracic spine (middle back), and the
                                        lumbar spine (lower back). Vertebrae in the spinal column are separated
                                        from each other by small "cushions" of cartilage known as inter (between) 
                                        vertebral (spinal bones) discs. The vertebrae and discs combine to create a
                                        space called (the intervertebral foramina or IVF) for each spinal nerve to
                                        exit from the spinal cord on its way to the body. Abnormal positioning of
                                        the vertebrae also known as (the vertebral subluxation complex or nerve 
                                        impingement syndrome) can compromise the IVF or nerve space, and create
                                        nerve irritation of nerve interference. The nerve will still influence 
                                        the muscle or organ it supplies; however, the quality of the nerve transmission
                                        will be affected.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Here's one of the most important concepts to grasp nerve interference may occurs 
                                        without a trace of any symptom. One more time. Nerve interference may occur without
                                        the trace of any symptoms. This point allows a sharper understanding of the wellness
                                        approach to health. Just like brushing your teeth before we get cavities, uncovering
                                        nerve interference before symptoms arise is a fundamental of Chiropractic care. Once
                                        detected, as a Doctor of Chiropractic, I am uniquely qualified and trained to apply 
                                        spinal adjustments. In fact, although other professional utilize spinal adjustments 
                                        as part of their treatment, Doctors of Chiropractic deliver 95% of ALL spinal adjustments
                                        and manipulations. Although each individual responds differently to chiropractic care,
                                        research reveals that most are very satisfied with the care that they receive. In fact, 
                                        a recent Gallup Poll of chiropractic patients conducted for the for the American Chiropractic
                                        Association
                                        (ACA) yielded some remarkable results about patients' opinions of the care that they received.

                                    Remember: Although the wellness approach to health may take some 
                                    getting used to, especially if you are accustomed to a sickness model of heath, 
                                    it is certainly well worth it! Dr. Timothy Richardson is a native Virginian.
