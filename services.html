                  Welcome to Chiropractic! We are glad you are here. Understanding Chiropractic:
                  Chiropractic Healthcare is a branch of medicine that is based on the scientific principle that our Central
                  Nervous System (CNS) controls or influences the functions of ALL 11 trillion interconnected cells in our
                  bodies. The term CHIROPRACTIC comes from the Greek word "Cheiro and Praktikos" meaning "done by hand." The
                  Chiropractic or wellness model of health is centered on the philosophy that the human body will heal itself
                  given the right opportunity. In other words, the body heals from the inside out. Interference to the nervous
                  system, caused by a vertebral subluxation complex (more commonly called a Subluxation)
                  will affect how the nervous system relates to the cells to which it influences.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Think of nerve irritation like a dimmer switch on your lights. If the dimmer is turned down, the lights are
                  still on, but the light is low. If it is turned up too high, the bulb may burn out prematurely; therefore,
                  the muscle or organ still receives the nerve impulse, but is altered. This helps to explain why when nerve
                  irritation exists in the middle back region, an individual may experience indigestion or an upset stomach.
                  As a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.), I essentially promote the healing process by minimizing interference to
                  the Central Nervous System. By detecting and correcting nerve interference, The Doctor of Chiropractic
                  facilitates the healing process,
                  but it is YOUR body that does the healing!

            Your spine is a column of more than 30 bones (vertebrae) held together by muscles, 
            tendons and ligaments and cushioned by shock-absorbing disks. A problem in any part of your
            spine can cause back pain.
